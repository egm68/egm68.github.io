I was awarded an [Honorable Mention](https://www.research.gov/grfp/AwardeeList.do?method=sort&page=67) (top 12%) for my NSF Graduate Research Fellowships Program (GRFP) research proposal. Thank you to my advisor, Claudio Silva, and to the NYU Tandon Writing Center, particularly Michele Hanks, Abby Rabinowitz, and Alexander Landfair, for their input on my proposal. Thank you as well to Weihong (Grace) Guo and Qian Zhu (and Claudio again) for writing letters in support of my application.
