I am currently a member of the [Visualization, Imaging, and Data Analysis Center](https://vida.engineering.nyu.edu/) advised by [Claudio Silva](https://ctsilva.github.io/). My research is focused on data visualization and augmented reality, particularly within the context of the [Perceptually-enabled Task Guidance project](https://www.darpa.mil/program/perceptually-enabled-task-guidance). I have prior experience in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and bioinformatics. 

To see more details about my education, experience, and contact information, please consult my [resume](https://egm68.github.io/cv/) or more comprehensive [CV](https://egm68.github.io/cv/). Use the navigation bar to see more information about my [published works](https://egm68.github.io/publications/) and [projects](https://egm68.github.io/repositories/).

Please feel free to reach out about research collaborations. I'm also currently looking for AI, data science, and research internship opportunities for Summer 2025.
